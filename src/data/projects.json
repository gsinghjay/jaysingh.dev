The gateway integrates deeply with existing identity providers and implements defense-in-depth security strategies to protect against common web vulnerabilities.",
    "challenge": "The university's legacy authentication system was fragmented across multiple applications, creating security gaps and poor user experience. Each service maintained its own authentication logic, leading to inconsistent security policies and increased attack surface. With 5,000+ active users including faculty, staff, and students accessing sensitive data, there was an urgent need for a centralized authentication solution that could enforce consistent security policies, provide audit trails, and integrate with existing Keycloak SSO infrastructure without disrupting ongoing operations.",
    "solution": "Designed a distributed gateway architecture using Traefik as the reverse proxy with OAuth2-Proxy middleware for authentication enforcement. Implemented granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies that evaluate user permissions at the gateway level before routing requests to backend services.

Custom dashboards provide at-a-glance views of critical metrics while automated alerting ensures immediate notification of anomalies.",
    "challenge": "Operating an 11-service microservices architecture without centralized observability created blind spots that made troubleshooting time-consuming and reactive. Logs were scattered across containers, metrics existed in isolated silos, and there was no way to trace requests across service boundaries. When issues occurred, the team spent hours correlating logs from different sources, often missing critical context. The lack of proactive monitoring meant problems were discovered by users rather than operations. The infrastructure needed a unified observability solution that could scale with the system while maintaining minimal performance overhead.",

Deployed Grafana with custom dashboards visualizing key performance indicators, request rates, error rates, and database query performance.
