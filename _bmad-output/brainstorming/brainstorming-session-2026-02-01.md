# Brainstorming Session: Sanity.io + GitHub Pages Opportunities

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst Agent)
**Participant:** Jay
**Duration:** Extended session with Epic 8 roadmapping

---

## Session Context

**Starting Point:** Epic 6 (Production Deployment & SEO) complete, heading into Epic 7 (Sanity.io CMS Integration)

**Key Constraint:** Free tier only
- Sanity: 100K API requests/mo, 10GB bandwidth, 5GB assets, unlimited editors
- GitHub Pages: 1GB storage, 100GB bandwidth/mo
- GitHub Actions: 2,000 minutes/mo

**Research Loaded:**
- Sanity.io documentation via Context7 (webhooks, content releases, scheduled publishing, image CDN, GROQ, draft perspectives)
- Existing epics.md and PRD

---

## Techniques Applied

### Round 1: SCAMPER Method
Systematic exploration through 7 lenses on "Sanity + GitHub Pages Static Site"

### Round 2: Cross-Pollination
Stealing patterns from e-commerce, publishing, music/streaming, gaming, education, and social media

### Round 3: Morphological Analysis
Mapping parameter combinations (content type × visibility × relationship × media × audience)

### Round 4: What If Scenarios
Radical possibilities pushing boundaries of static site + headless CMS

### Round 5: Educational Platform Deep Dive
Extended exploration of capstone class management use case
