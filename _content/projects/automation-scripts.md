Developed comprehensive automation scripts using Python, Bash, PowerShell, and Ansible to automate routine sysadmin tasks and streamline infrastructure changes. Created password reset automation, user provisioning workflows, system health checks, and deployment scripts.

## Challenge

IT operations were burdened with repetitive manual tasks that consumed significant time and were prone to human error. Password resets, user provisioning, and system maintenance required constant manual intervention. There was no standardized approach to common operations, leading to inconsistent results.

## Solution

Built a library of automation scripts covering common IT operations. Implemented Python scripts for complex workflows with proper error handling and logging. Created Ansible playbooks for configuration management and deployment tasks. Developed PowerShell scripts for Windows environment management and Active Directory operations.

## Impact

Increased IT operational efficiency by 40% by automating routine tasks. Reduced manual workload across IT operations, freeing time for higher-value work. Improved consistency and reliability through standardized automated processes. Enabled self-service capabilities for common user requests.
