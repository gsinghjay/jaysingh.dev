An enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure platform that automates deployment, scaling, and monitoring for distributed systems.

## Challenge

Managing cloud infrastructure at scale requires automation, visibility, and reliability. Manual processes don't scale.

## Solution

Built a comprehensive platform using Go for performance-critical components, PostgreSQL for state management, and AWS services for cloud-native capabilities.

## Impact

Reduced deployment time by 80% and improved system reliability to 99.99% uptime.
