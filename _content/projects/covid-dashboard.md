Personalized COVID-19 community web dashboard built using Microsoft's Power Platform under Professor Mohammed Imam. Converted Excel/CSV/PDF files into maintainable and usable data for relational database. Employed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL to create interactive dashboard enhancing data accessibility and visualization for community health monitoring.

## Challenge

Community health data was scattered across multiple formats including Excel spreadsheets, CSV exports, and PDF reports. There was no centralized way to visualize trends or make the data accessible to community members and decision makers. Manual data aggregation was time-consuming and error-prone.

## Solution

Built a web-based dashboard that automatically ingests data from various sources and normalizes it into a MySQL database. Created interactive visualizations using JavaScript that allow users to explore trends over time. Implemented responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices.

## Impact

Provided real-time visibility into community health metrics for decision makers. Reduced data aggregation time from hours to minutes through automated processing. Enabled community members to access clear, understandable health information. Supported data-driven decisions during a critical public health period.
