challenge: "Managing a growing fleet of macOS devices manually was becoming unsustainable. New device provisioning required hours of hands-on configuration, and there was no standardized approach to software deployment or security policy enforcement. IT staff spent significant time on routine device management tasks."
solution: "Implemented Jamf Pro as the centralized MDM solution for all macOS devices. Configured Apple DEP for zero-touch device enrollment, allowing new Macs to be shipped directly to end users. Set up VPP for automated app deployment and licensing management. Created standardized configuration profiles for security policies and device settings."
impact: "Reduced new device provisioning time from hours to minutes through automated enrollment. Successfully migrated 150+ existing devices with zero downtime or user disruption. Improved security posture through consistent policy enforcement across all devices. Enabled self-service capabilities that reduced IT support tickets."
keyFeatures:
  - "Zero-touch device enrollment with Apple DEP integration"
  - "Automated app deployment through Apple VPP"
  - "Standardized security policies and configuration profiles"
  - "Self-service app catalog for end users"
