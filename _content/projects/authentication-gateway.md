An enterprise-grade authentication and authorization gateway implementing zero-trust security principles.

## Challenge

Legacy authentication was fragmented across multiple applications, creating security gaps and poor user experience.

## Solution

Designed a distributed gateway architecture using Traefik as the reverse proxy with OAuth2-Proxy middleware for authentication enforcement.

## Impact

Successfully secured 5,000+ active user accounts with zero security incidents since deployment.
